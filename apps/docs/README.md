## Next.js Documentation (WIP)

This app will be the new home for the Next.js documentation, currently in active development.

### What to Expect

- Content is being migrated from our internal monorepo
- The design is not yet final
- Internal tooling and structure may change

### Contributing

We'll open this app to contributions once the initial migration is complete. In the meantime, feel free to follow along or open an issue with the `documentation` tag.

### Feedback

For questions or early feedback, contact [Delba](https://github.com/delbaoliveira) or [Joseph](https://github.com/icyJoseph).
