       To fix this, you can either:

       Wrap the component in a <Suspense> boundary. This allows Next.js to stream its contents to the user as soon as it's ready, without blocking the rest of the app.

       or

       Move the asynchronous await into a Cache Component ("use cache"). This allows Next.js to statically prerender the component as part of the HTML document, so it's instantly visible to the user.

       Note that request-specific information — such as params, cookies, and headers — is not available during static prerendering, so must be wrapped in <Suspense>.

       To fix this, you can either:

       Wrap the component in a <Suspense> boundary. This allows Next.js to stream its contents to the user as soon as it's ready, without blocking the rest of the app.

       or

       Move the asynchronous await into a Cache Component ("use cache"). This allows Next.js to statically prerender the component as part of the HTML document, so it's instantly visible to the user.

       Note that request-specific information — such as params, cookies, and headers — is not available during static prerendering, so must be wrapped in <Suspense>.
