title: 'No children were passed to `<Link>`'
---

> **Note**: Starting with version `16`, Next.js does not support the `legacyBehavior` prop for a `Link` component anymore . `<Link>` now renders an `<a>` element automatically, and does not restrict the number of children passed to it.

## Why This Error Occurred

In your application code, `next/link` was used without passing a child:

For example:

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior></Link>
      // or
      <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Make sure one child is used when using `<Link>`:

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link href="/about">To About</Link>
      // or
      <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior>
        <a>To About</a>
      </Link>
    </>
  )
}
```
